A fine assortment of my yak shaved files

### Emphasis on:
 - Less typing
 - "Unix as an IDE"
 - Being able to reproduce my settings basically anywhere

#### Worth noting:
 - This directory is actually my `~/.config/` directory. This is why the `.gitignore` file contains a lot of seemingly strange directories.
 - The `.setup/` directory automates __most__ of this process. The linker script `.setup/linker.sh` will do a lot of the work
 - A lot of this expects there is a `~/GitHub/` directory. What's expected to be there lives in the file `.setup/cloneWars.sh`

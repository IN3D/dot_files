** About
   From about 2010 to 2016 I used Vim, getting deeper into it as the years went
   on. In 2015 I was formally introduced to Emacs; which started a long
   back-and-forth between the two. I eventually decided on Emacs and began the
   process of learning more and more about it.
   Originally my workflow was based around Vim and Tmux, heavily focused on the
   CLI. Increasingly, my workflow is centering around Emacs (though there's
   still at least one terminal running in Emacs at all times). This is all still
   very much a work in progress. My Emacs config is still coming together!
